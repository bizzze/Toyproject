            London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city
            in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million
            inhabitants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for
            two millennia,its history going back to its founding by the Romans,
            who named it Londinium.
          </p>
          <p>
            London, also referred to as Greater London, is one of 9 regions of
            England and the top-level subdivision covering most of the city's
            metropolis. The small ancient City of London at its core once
            comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the
            Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with
            its suburbs, causing "London" to be defined in a number ways for
            different purposes.
